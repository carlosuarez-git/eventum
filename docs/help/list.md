# Listing / Searching for Issues

The Issue Listing page uses a grid layout to simplify the manual search for
issues in a project. You may sort for (almost) any column in this grid form, and
users with the appropriate permissions may also assign selected issues to
another user.

The quick search table in the top of the screen helps the users find the issues
they want quickly. More advanced searches may be created using the Advanced
Search tool.

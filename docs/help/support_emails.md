# Associate Emails

This screen allows users with the appropriate permissions to associate emails
with existing issues, or create new issues and associate emails with them.

In order to do that, however, the administrator of the system needs to configure
email accounts to make the software download the email messages from the
appropriate POP3/IMAP server.

One of the optimal uses of this feature is to create a separate `issues` or
`support` POP3/IMAP account and ask your customers or end-users to send support
questions, issues or suggestions to that mailbox. Eventum will then download the
emails and provide them to the users of the system.

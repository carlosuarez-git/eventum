# Priority Field

This field is used to prioritize issues, as to make project management a little
easier. If you are not sure, or don't know what the appropriate priority should
be for new issues, choose 'not prioritized' as the option and leave the issue to
be prioritized by a project manager.

Note: The values in this field can be changed by going in the administration
section of this application and editing the appropriate attributes of a project.
If you do not have the needed permissions to do so, please contact your local
Eventum administrator.

# Account Preferences

This screen allows users to change their appropriate full name, account password
and email address. This address will be used by the system to send email
notifications whenever details about issues you are subscribed to changes.

You may also set the appropriate timezone where you live in this screen, and all
of the software will adjust the dates displayed in the system accordingly.

The default options for email notifications are used to pre-select the
notification related fields when you report a new issue, or subscribe manually
for changes in the issue details page.

# Email Blocking

To prevent inappropriate emails reaching the notification list, only users that
are assigned to the issue are allowed to email through Eventum. If an
un-authorized user sends an email to `issue-XXXX@example.com` it is converted
into a note and stored for later use. This note can be converted into an email
at a later date.
